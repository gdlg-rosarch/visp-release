\page tutorial-install-centos Tutorial: Installation from source on Linux CentOS
\tableofcontents

In this tutorial you will learn how to install ViSP from source on CentOS. These steps have been tested for CentOS 7.0 (x86_64) distribution, but should work with any other distribution as well. 

\note Concerning ViSP installation, we provide also other \ref tutorial.

\section install_centos_required Required packages

- gcc 4.4.x or later. This can be installed with:
\code
sudo yum install gcc-c++
\endcode
- CMake 2.6 or higher that could be installed with:
\code
sudo yum install cmake
\endcode

ViSP is interfaced with several optional <a href="http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/visp/libraries.html">third-party libraries</a>. The installation of the corresponding packages is described in \ref install_centos_3rdparty section.

\section install_centos_get_source Getting ViSP source code

There are different ways to get ViSP source code:

- You can download the <a href="http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/visp/download.html#latest">latest stable release</a> as a zip or a tarball. Once downloaded, uncompress the file using either
\code
tar xvzf ViSP-2.10.0.tar.gz 
\endcode
or
\code
unzip ViSP-2.10.0.zip
\endcode

- You can also download a more <a href="http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/visp/download.html#snapshot">recent snapshot</a>. Once downloaded, uncompress the file using
\code
unzip ViSP-2.y.z-snapshot-2015.mm.dd.zip
\endcode
- Or you get the cutting-edge ViSP from Subversion repository. To this end you have first to install subversion
\code
sudo yum install subversion
\endcode
and then use the following command
\code
svn checkout svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/visp/trunk/ViSP ViSP-trunk
\endcode

We suppose now that ViSP source is in a directory denoted  \<source_dir\>, for example \c $HOME/ViSP-2.10.0

\section install_centos_config Configuring ViSP from source

- Create first a directory denoted \<binary_dir\> where you want to build ViSP. This directory will contain generated Makefiles, object files, and output libraries and binaries.
\code
cd $HOME; mkdir ViSP-build-release
\endcode

- Enter the \<binary_dir\> and to configure the build type:
\code
cmake [<optional parameters>] <source_dir>
\endcode
For example:
\code
cd $HOME/ViSP-build-release
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON ../ViSP-2.10.0
\endcode
A more versatile way to configure the build is to use \c ccmake, the CMake GUI:
\code
ccmake ../ViSP-2.10.0
\endcode
The following image shows that this command allows to configure (just by pressing [c] key) the build in a more advanced way where some options could be easily turned On/Off. It allows also to see which are the 3rd parties that will be used.
\image html img-ccmake-centos.png Snapshot of the ccmake \c ../ViSP-2.10.0 command used to configure ViSP.

- There is an other way to see which are the 3rd parties that are found during the configuration stage and that will be used by ViSP during the build. To this end you can have a look to the text file named ViSP-third-party.txt and located in \<binary_dir\>. We provide hereafter an example of a possible content of this file:
\code
                    ViSP third-party libraries

build ViSP on your computer.

\subsection install_centos_3rdparty Optional 3rd party packages

As mentioned previously, ViSP is interfaced with some 3rd party libraries. The <a href="http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/visp/libraries.html">complete list is provided here</a>. We recommend to install the following:

- OpenCV
\code
sudo yum install opencv-devel
\endcode
- libX11 to be able to open a window to display images
\code
sudo yum install libX11-devel
\endcode
- lapack and gsl to benefit from optimized mathematical capabilities
\code
sudo yum install lapack-devel gsl-devel
\endcode
- libv4l to grab images from usb or analogic cameras
\code
sudo yum install libv4l-devel
\endcode
- libxml2 to be able to configure the model-based trackers from xml files
\code
sudo yum install libxml2-devel
\endcode
- libjpeg, libpng to support jpeg and png images
\code
sudo yum install libjpeg-devel libpng-devel
\endcode

Once installed, if you want that ViSP exploit the new 3rd parties, you have to configure ViSP again.

\code
ccmake ../ViSP-2.10.0
\endcode
The following image shows now that all the previous optional 3rd parties are detected.
\image html img-ccmake-centos-all.png Snapshot of the ccmake \c ../ViSP-2.10.0 command used to configure ViSP after installation of optional 3rd party libraries.

\note Other <a href="http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/visp/libraries.html">3rd party libraries</a> are interfaced with ViSP. This is for example the case of <a href="http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/visp/librarieslist.html#Ogre">Ogre</a> that can be used to enhance the visibility computation of the faces that are tracked with the model-based tracker (see \ref tutorial-tracking-mb), or <a href="http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/visp/librarieslist.html#Coin">Coin</a> that can be used to parse vrml files that describe the 3D model of the object to track using the same model-based tracker. It seems that these 3rd parties are not packaged on CentOS. If you want to use these 3rd parties, you have to install them from source code.

\subsection install_centos_generate Generating Makefiles

To generate the makefiles, just press [g] key in the ccmake gui.

Now we can build ViSP.

\subsection install_centos_issues Known issues

- On CentOS 7.0 with cmake 2.8.11, during cmake configuration you may encounter the following issue:
\code
CMake Warning at src/CMakeLists.txt:80 (add_library):
   Cannot generate a safe runtime search path for target visp because files in
   some directories may conflict with libraries in implicit directories:

     runtime library [libpthread.so] in /usr/lib64 may be hidden by files in:
       //lib64

   Some of these libraries may not be found correctly.
\endcode
The problem was that libpthread.so exists in /usr/lib64 and in //lib64. In //lib64 it should be a symbolic link to /usr/lib64.
\code
$ ls -als //lib64
  0 lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 9 Feb  4 12:16 //lib64 -> usr/lib64
$ ls -als //lib64/libpthread*
140 -rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 141616 Jan 27 15:13 //lib64/libpthread-2.17.so
  4 -rw-r--r--. 1 root root    222 Jan 27 14:42 //lib64/libpthread.so
  0 lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root     18 Feb  4 12:34 //lib64/libpthread.so.0 -> libpthread-2.17.so
\endcode  
The fix consists in removing //lib64/libpthread.so and creating a new symbolic link
\code
$ cd //lib64
$ sudo rm libpthread.so
$ sudo ln -s libpthread-2.17.so libpthread.so
$ ls -als libpthread*
140 -rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 141616 Jan 27 15:13 libpthread-2.17.so
  0 lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root     18 Feb  4 16:09 libpthread.so -> libpthread-2.17.so
  0 lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root     18 Feb  4 12:34 libpthread.so.0 -> libpthread-2.17.so
\endcode

- On CentOS 7.0, vpVideoReader is not able to read mpeg videos. If ffmpeg is not installed (this is our case since ffmpeg is not packaged for CentOS 7.0), this class uses OpenCV to read and decode videos. Some examples or tutorials provided in ViSP hang during cv::Capture::open() call. The reason is that OpenCV 2.4.5 cv::Capture seams buggy. This is for example the case if you run:
\code
$ ./example/video/videoReader
\endcode
A work arround consists in installing a more recent OpenCV version from source. 

\section install_centos_build Building ViSP from source

- To build ViSP proceed with:
\code
make -j4
\endcode

- To install ViSP proceed with:
\code
sudo make install
\endcode

- To build ViSP documentation, you have first to install Doxygen package:
\code
sudo yum install doxygen graphviz
\endcode
Then you can proceed with:
\code
make visp_doc
\endcode

You are now ready to see the next \ref tutorial-getting-started that will show you how to use ViSP as a 3rd party to build your own project.
