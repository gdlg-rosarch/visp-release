\tableofcontents

In this tutorial you will learn how to install ViSP from source on Linux Ubuntu. These steps have been tested for Ubuntu 14.04 (64 bit) distribution, but should work with any other distribution as well. 

\note Concerning ViSP installation, we provide also other \ref tutorial.

\section install_ubuntu_required Required packages

- gcc 4.4.x or later. This can be installed with:
\code
sudo apt-get install build-essential
\endcode
- CMake 2.6 or higher that could be installed with:
\code
sudo apt-get install cmake-curses-gui
\endcode


ViSP is interfaced with several optional <a href="http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/visp/libraries.html">third-party libraries</a>. The installation of the corresponding packages is described in \ref install_ubuntu_3rdparty section.

\section install_ubuntu_get_source Getting ViSP source code

There are different ways to get ViSP source code:

- You can download the <a href="http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/visp/download.html#latest">latest stable release</a> as a zip or a tarball. Once downloaded, uncompress the file using either
\code
tar xvzf ViSP-2.10.0.tar.gz 
\endcode
or
\code
unzip ViSP-2.10.0.zip
\endcode

- You can also download a more <a href="http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/visp/download.html#snapshot">recent snapshot</a>. Once downloaded, uncompress the file using
\code
unzip ViSP-2.y.z-snapshot-2015.mm.dd.zip
\endcode
- Or you get the cutting-edge ViSP from Subversion repository. To this end you have first to install subversion
\code
sudo apt-get install subversion
\endcode
and then use the following command
\code
svn checkout svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/visp/trunk/ViSP ViSP-trunk
\endcode

We suppose now that ViSP source is in a directory denoted  \<source_dir\>, for example \c $HOME/ViSP-2.10.0

\section install_ubuntu_config Configuring ViSP from source

- Create first a directory denoted \<binary_dir\> where you want to build ViSP. This directory will contain generated Makefiles, object files, and output libraries and binaries.
\code
cd $HOME; mkdir ViSP-build-release
\endcode

- Enter the \<binary_dir\> and to configure the build type:
\code
cmake [<optional parameters>] <source_dir>
\endcode
For example:
\code
cd $HOME/ViSP-build-release
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON ../ViSP-2.10.0
\endcode
A more versatile way to configure the build is to use \c ccmake, the CMake GUI:
\code
ccmake ../ViSP-2.10.0
\endcode
The following image shows that this command allows to configure (just by pressing [c] key) the build in a more advanced way where some options could be easily turned On/Off. It allows also to see which are the 3rd parties that will be used.
\image html img-ccmake-ubuntu.png Snapshot of the ccmake \c ../ViSP-2.10.0 command used to configure ViSP.

- There is an other way to see which are the 3rd parties that are found during the configuration stage and that will be used by ViSP during the build. To this end you can have a look to the text file named ViSP-third-party.txt and located in \<binary_dir\>. We provide hereafter an example of a possible content of this file:
\code

\subsection install_ubuntu_3rdparty Optional 3rd party packages

As mentioned previously, ViSP is interfaced with some 3rd party libraries. The <a href="http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/visp/libraries.html">complete list is provided here</a>. We recommend to install the following:

- OpenCV
\code
sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev
\endcode
- libX11 to be able to open a window to display images
\code
sudo apt-get install libx11-dev
\endcode
- lapack and GSL to benefit from optimized mathematical capabilities
\code
sudo apt-get install liblapack-dev libgsl0-dev
\endcode
- libdc1394 to grab images from firewire cameras
\code
sudo apt-get install libdc1394-22-dev
\endcode
- libv4l to grab images from usb or analogic cameras
\code
sudo apt-get install libv4l-dev
\endcode
- Coin, to be able to support vrml cad model used by the model-based trackers
\code
sudo apt-get install libCoin80-dev
\endcode
- libxml2 to be able to configure the model-based trackers from xml files
\code
sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev
\endcode
- libjpeg, libpng to support jpeg and png images
\code
sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev libpng12-dev
\endcode
- ffmpeg, to be able to read or encode compressed video streams
\code
sudo apt-get install libswscale-dev libavutil-dev libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libbz2-dev libbz2-1.0
\endcode
- Ogre 3D if you want to do augmented reality or simulation
\code
sudo apt-get install libogre-1.9-dev libois-dev
\endcode
- Bar code detection
\code
sudo apt-get install libzbar-dev libdmtx-dev
\endcode

Once installed, if you want that ViSP exploit the new 3rd party, you have to configure ViSP again.

\code
ccmake ../ViSP-2.10.0
\endcode
The following image shows now that all the previous optional 3rd parties are detected.
\image html img-ccmake-ubuntu-all.png Snapshot of the ccmake \c ../ViSP-2.10.0 command used to configure ViSP after installation of optional 3rd party libraries.

\subsection install_ubuntu_generate Generating Makefiles

To generate the makefiles, just press [g] key in the ccmake gui.

Now we can build ViSP.

\section install_ubuntu_build Building ViSP from source

- To build ViSP proceed with:
\code
make -j4
\endcode

- To install ViSP proceed with:
\code
sudo make install
\endcode

- To build ViSP documentation, you have first to install Doxygen package:
\code
sudo apt-get install doxygen graphviz texlive-latex-base
\endcode
Then you can proceed with:
\code
make visp_doc
\endcode

You are now ready to see the next \ref tutorial-getting-started that will show you how to use ViSP as a 3rd party to build your own project.
